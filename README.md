# Ticket-price-prediction
This repository included a group project i participated in University of Cyprus for the course "Data Mining on the Web". We synthesised a system to predict the price of ticket planes using a dataset from MachineHack. We analysed the data to select the most useful columns, preprocessed the data (One Hot Encoding, Cyclical Transformation) and in the end we tested a variety of machine learning algorithms and features to find the best.
